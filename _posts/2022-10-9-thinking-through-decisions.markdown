recently i was chatting with a younger friend about internship-searching. so i went back into my notes and found a couple notes where i thought through my internship strategy. realized in retrospect that i had accomplished everything that i wanted to accomplish - and it felt extremely validating! that all my thinking, planning, strategizing leads to me getting exactly what i want.

by nature, i'm super Type A, for better or for worse. i feel anxious when i have *no* plan for major decisions in the near future. there are its pros: i'm able to strategize to achieve my goals. and of course, there are its cons: by planning all my weekends and plans, i miss out on the serendipity that comes from spontaneity.

it works for me though, since this is how i naturally think and operate. (ironically, in order to balance out the planned-unplanned in my life, i schedule in unplanned blocks of time. lol.) i'm sure that as i get older and experience more of the world, my philosophies will change.

at this point though, it's an interesting thought exercise for me to write about how i think through important plans/decisions. i also get questions about it occasionally, so i thought i'd post it to my blog! that hopefully no one really reads!

obviously this doesn't hold for everything -- over-rigid plans, over-done planning, futurecasting "10-year goals", etc can be counterproductive. the goal is to live a life that makes you feel fulfilled! thus you need to be able to be flexible & dynamic with your goals/plans as life situations and values and circumstances and opportunities change. let life take you in the direction that it takes you!

[(see my other post on making decisions.)](https://kristiehuang.com/blog/2021/08/30/decisions.html)

without further ado, the kristie algorithm for thinking through a hard decision or big plan:
* list out my overarching reasons for why i care about this in the first place, and all my requisites
  * this helps orient my mind so that i stay true to myself instead of getting distracted with all the other pressures that might come up
* enumerate my potential options
* braindump a list of all my open questions, then talk through them with myself + with trusted people
  * loop through answering questions while iterating on a possible solution until i come to a solution that i'm happy with
* but- if and when life changes it up on you, it's ok!! trust the process.

this really does feel like i'm thinking *through* a decision. i sit down and submerge myself in enumerating all the questions related to the decision, looping through Q&A with myself + trusted people until i start nearing the end of the tunnel. for a big, important plan, a process like this takes weeks.

## for example: internship-planning in sophomore year
in my sophomore spring, i was getting ready to prep for recruiting szn for the following summer. i had finished my first SWE internship at FB the summer prior and was about to do a return SWE internship at FB that summer.

at this point, i had junior summer left, and a potential off-season internship left, before needing to make a decision for my new grad fulltime role. i was also debating between pm vs swe. (a classic cs/business college kid dilemma.) i needed to know how to focus my recruiting efforts so that it would take me in the career direction that would make me happieset!

plz don't cringe or clown me too hard; here are the actual, unedited notes i took for myself in soph year:
(the questions&answers i had here were the result of many, many conversations with people and mentors i trusted.)

![enumerating options, and making da decision](/assets/blog/decisions-career.png)

having made this decision, it helped me really narrow down the companies i would focus my recruiting efforts on the following semester, instead of trying to apply everywhere and do poorly overall.

what i actually did:
* frosh summer: FB SWE intern (via freshman program, was more of a summer camp than an intenship)
* soph off-szn: Pantera VC platform/content intern
* soph summer: FB SWE intern (crypto wallet team)
* jr off-szn: Nascent VC SWE intern (10 person team)
* jr summer: Uniswap SWE intern (~100 headcount)
* sr: signed ft offer for Uniswap SWE

## another example: solo travel-planning after graduation
big goal of mine is to get some solo travelling in after i graduate. it's the time of my life to see the world without obligations - no job, no family, no health issues.

it's such a major, ambiguous plan that i needed to think it through - i'm not (yet) the type of person to embark on a multi-week international trip solo without having planned it through.

i won't post the rest (lots of personal info) - but i had sections of questions around "when, who, budgeting, where". based on my iterating q&a process with myself, ended up creating a couple versions of itineraries:

it was helpful for me to write down that i cared about slower travelling and going out of my comfort zone and seeing beautiful views. it reminds me as i plan that i don't need to checklist-travel (i.e. "i went to 10 countries in a week!"). or, that it's okay to skip the expensive, "must-do" jungraujoch trip in favor of a day on the interlaken lakes. that if i miss out on the italian dolomites this time, it's totally alright because it means i'll be less stressed on meeting time schedules + it'll give me an excuse to come back again!
