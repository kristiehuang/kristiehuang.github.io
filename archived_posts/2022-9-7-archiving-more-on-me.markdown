### Learning in non-private

_[edit: I no longer update this!]_

Learning (outside of school) has always been a pretty private, siloed experience for me. Trying a new experiment: [learning in "public"](https://www.notion.so/dual-effort-learning-in-public-cc9ff63eabc64d27a3efe45369fccd88)!

For now, it's going to be mostly crypto-centric. The intention is to be more authentic and transparent with my progress, and I'm starting by publicizing some of my own messy, non-linear notes. I'm not editing for the public eye, so there's no guarantee for grammar, orderliness, or even correctness.

Notice that I got something wrong? Commenting functionality is on, so please do feel free to leave feedback!

### On art & colors, on tech, and on my journey

From when I was five to when I graduated high school, I lived every single weekend in a small, unassuming art studio. I wanted to become a professional oil painter and to go to art school. Growing up, most of my garments were splattered with [paint](https://www.behance.net/gallery/72001185/Kristie-Huang-Art-Portfolio).

So I’m a pretty visual learner and thinker. Unironically, I love asking about people's favorite colors! Coral-red #ff9980, for example, is my favorite color—it’s bright, energetic, and powerfully feminine. My friends call it “Kristie red” :)

In addition to the fine arts, I dabbled in writing. Won a couple writing contests in [elementary](https://web.archive.org/web/20120415084842/https://www.tuolumne.org/content/article.php/20120410143026414) + [middle](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421063816/https://sanfrancisco.adl.org/news/41827/) [school](https://web.archive.org/web/20170429092315/https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/05/21/palo-alto-student-wins-essay-contest/). In seventh grade, I got to 25k/50k words in NaNoWriMo. In high school, I was editor-in-chief of the [creative magazine](https://issuu.com/pandorasbox.gunn) for two years, growing readership by 20x.

Then I tried debating in Model UN for two years. Then I nearly became an international relations / economics major (thank you, [YYGS](https://globalscholars.yale.edu/international-affairs-globalization)!).

So I never thought I'd be a ~tech~ person.

But when I tried my hand at [UI design](https://www.behance.net/kristiehuang), I loved being able to create prototypes of things I could actually use. Then, I wanted to go from prototypes to real, functioning apps. I spent the summer after tenth grade learning to code at Make School—where I shipped my first two [real](https://tinyurl.com/cloudcloset) [apps](https://tinyurl.com/airtimeevents).

It's been a whirlwind since then.

### Support systems

Thank you to Rewriting the Code + NCWIT + Built By Girls + Tech Ladies for being THE reason why I'm in tech today. I literally would not be in tech if it wasn't for these online support systems. I give back my time frequently to younger girls breaking into tech + helping with college apps, because I know how absolutely essential it was for me.

Also forever grateful to my friends, current & ex-boyfriends, mentors, and family for shaping me into who I am today. You know who you are.

### Miscellaneous

- I have idiopathic scoliosis! Wore a plastic back brace for 23 hours a day from 4th to 9th grade to avoid open-back surgery. I was a hardy fourth grader—literally :’) When I was 14, I started a [Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/state-of-california-mandate-life-saving-scoliosis-screenings-in-elementary-schools) to the CA governor to mandate scoliosis screenings in elementary schools. It gathered hundreds of comments & 10k signatures. Nothing came out of it though, unfortunately.
- In 7-9th grade, I ran a [studyblr](https://studycxlture.tumblr.com/) with 10k followers :)
