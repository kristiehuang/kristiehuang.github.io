      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Heya; welcome to my corner of the Internet! I'm a full-time dual-degree student at UC Berkeley (go bears),
        full-time DeFi evangelist, and, most importantly, full-time human being.</p>
      <p>I use she/her pronouns. My curiosities include startups, crypto, diversity/equity/inclusion, and
        product. More recently, though, I've been thinking about wellness/happiness, solitude, and what it means to be
        successful. I also recently moved into my first ever apartment; please send me your Pinterest boards and
        favorite houseplant recommendations :)</p>

      <h2>More on me</h2>
      <p class="lead">Art & colors:</p>
      <p>From the age of five, I believed I was destined to become an oil painter. I was essentially fostered for twelve years in a small, unventilated art studio. Growing up, most of my jeans and pants were splattered with <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/72001185/Kristie-Huang-Art-Portfolio">paint</a>.</p>
      <p>So I'm a pretty visual learner and thinker. To me, someone's favorite color says a lot about them. Coral-red <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/ff9980">#ff9980</a> is my favorite color‚Äîit's bright, energetic, and powerfully feminine. My friends call it "Kristie red" :)</p>
      <p class="lead">On tech:</p>
      <p>
        I almost went to art school. I got to 25k/50k words in my NaNoWriMo novel in my 7th grade. Then I nearly became an international relations / economics major (thank you, <a href="https://globalscholars.yale.edu/international-affairs-globalization">YYGS</a>!). I was never a ~tech~ person & won't ever be fully tech to the core.</p>
      <p>
        I do love to create though, and I'm passionate about creating impact. I'm still figuring things out, but I think this is where software's speed of iteration and accessibility to beginners ultimately won out. Things first started as I ventured from physical painting&drawing to <a href="">designing visual interfaces</a>. Then, after dozens of Sketch files and Invision prototypes, I wanted to try my hand at building out some of these products.</p>
      <p>
        I was very privileged to be able to spend my 10th grade summer at Make School's Summer Academy‚Äîwhere I first learned to code & shipped my first <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cloudcloset">two</a> <a href="http://tinyurl.com/airtimeevents">products</a>. Cue the hackathons, CS classes, and engineering major declaration. Along the way, I learned the 16-character term for new product creation: entrepreneurship. It was an opportunity to translate ideas into real impact for real people.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now I'm pursuing a dual-degree in EECS and Business in UC Berkeley's M.E.T. program. Sounds real 
        ~tech-to-the-core~, I know. I think it's the fastest path from where I am to being able to create things to help people though. And because of my non-tech background, I know the user experience is the most important element to any product.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">My thoughts on crypto:</p>
      <p>Vanessa Slavich from Celo breaks crypto down into three camps: <a
          href="https://link.medium.com/wMcJmALc68">‚Äúget rich quick, libertarians, and social change‚Äù</a>. I‚Äôm personally, like Vanessa, most excited about the latter ‚Äî financial inclusion & accessibility made possible by DeFi. In 2020, billions of people across the globe have access to a mobile phone but don‚Äôt have access to crossborder financial systems.</p>
      <p>
        Beyond financial accessibility though, I think there are some really exciting projects using blockchain to push the boundaries of everything that we know. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôm thinking about projects like Alex Masmej‚Äôs self-tokenization; Foundation using crypto as a new revenue vehicle for creators; Dharma building a neobank on top of Compound. We‚Äôre able to redefine what it means to own something and what it means to have money.
      </p>
        But, despite all the cool things being currently worked on, there‚Äôs so much more work to be done. We can‚Äôt have widespread crypto adoption without important work done in user experience -- to this day, crypto‚Äôs understood to the layman & laywoman as nothing but a volatile commodity and a payment vehicle for illegal marketplaces. And for those just starting to explore crypto, technical jargon like <a href="https://www.dharma.io/">‚Äúgas‚Äù, ‚Äúseed phrases‚Äù, and ‚Äúnon-custodial‚Äù</a> scare beginners away. From a regulatory standpoint, Libra‚Äôs still absolutely pushing the envelope by building a whole new payment rail from scratch. Smart contract exploits happen all the time. <a href="https://she256.org/about/">Financial inclusion can‚Äôt happen unless the people building these systems are diverse.</a> (And we still don‚Äôt know who Satoshi is.) I think, for the time being at least, that this is where I want be.

      <p class="lead">Miscellaneous:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have idiopathic scoliosis! Wore a back brace for 23 hours a day from 4th to 9th grade to avoid open-back
          surgery. I was a hardy fourth grader‚Äîliterally :') When I was 14, I started a <a
            href="https://www.change.org/p/state-of-california-mandate-life-saving-scoliosis-screenings-in-elementary-schools">Change.org
            petition</a> to the CA governor to mandate scoliosis screenings in elementary schools. It gathered hundreds
          of heartfelt comments & 10k signatures. Nothing came out of it though, unfortunately.</li>
        <li>A favorite quarantine read: <a href="https://www.ankit.fyi/being-alone">Ankit Shah's essay on Being
            Alone</a></li>
        <li>My productivity stack: Bear, OneNote, GCal, Notion, Spark</li>
        <li>I'm an ESTJ</li>
        <li>Love dried fruits too much for my own good</li>
        <li>I own too many scrunchies :(</li>
        <li>big lowercase text advocate</li>
        <li>Some other things I enjoy: volleyball, college consulting, thrifting</li>
