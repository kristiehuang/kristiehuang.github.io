            <p style="font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light;">
                Hey, I’m Kristie! I’m passionate about product management and technological entrepreneurship.
                <br>
                Looking for product, venture, or software internships for summer 2020!
                <br>
                <br>
                Previously, I built and shipped two iOS apps to the App Store—one of which was converted into a revenue-generating business. I'm comfortable programming in Swift, Java, and Python. Additionally, I did quite a bit of interface design, primarily with Sketch and InVision. With my art background, I also led a team of 12 to design, copyedit, fund, and promote a creative magazine.
                <br>
                <br>
                This summer, I'm working on the design and product teams for a payments app at a startup. I hope to translate my experience driving the full product lifecycle in the startup sector to a larger corporation, with a stronger mentoring system but the same fast-paced innovation.
