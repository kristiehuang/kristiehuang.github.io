I'm a software engineer at Uniswap Labs in NYC. Graduated from UC Berkeley M.E.T. with degrees in EECS + Business in 2023.

<h3><a id="home-work-label" href="/work">Work</a></h3>

I care deeply about building a more inclusive world. It’s why I’ve spent so much energy on creating equitable financial systems at Uniswap Labs & Facebook, and fostering better innovation ecosystems through my work at she256, Nascent & Pantera Capital.

I’m also a Type A planner who seeks out Type II fun. I love hard hikes, backpacking, volleyball, immersive travel, and being out on the water. In college, I paddled competitively with Cal Dragon Boat. I travel solo often in chase of big mountain views around the world. (See my travel log at [@kristieintheworld](https://www.instagram.com/kristieintheworld)!) Being able to stay active is a privilege I don’t take for granted since I could never participate in sports growing up due to my scoliosis.
