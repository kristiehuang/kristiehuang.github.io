## Hi - I‚Äôm Kristie! üëã

I‚Äôm soon to move to NYC to join Uniswap Labs as a software engineer, after recently graduating from UC Berkeley with degrees in EECS & business. 

I‚Äôm a crypto geek who's spent time working for crypto protocols, wallets, venture funds, and nonprofits. Building a more inclusive world matters a lot to me ‚Äî it's why I've spent so much energy working towards more globally-inclusive financial systems, gender equity in tech, and better innovation ecosystems.

I‚Äôm also Type A planner who seeks out Type II fun. I love hard hikes, backpacking, volleyball, immersive travel, and being out on the water. In college, I paddled competitively with Cal Dragon Boat. After graduating, I travelled Europe solo for a couple weeks and hiked (part of) the Tour du Mont Blanc. Being able to stay active is a privilege I don‚Äôt take for granted since I could never participate in sports growing up due to my scoliosis.
