## Hey, Iâ€™m Kristie! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a crypto geek, lifelong student (currently at UC Berkeley), and human being. (she/her)

My "resumÃ©" curiosities include startups, decentralized systems, fintech, diversity/equity/inclusion, and product. Beyond work, though, Iâ€™ve been reflecting on wellness, sustainable happiness, privilege, relationships, and success. Welcome to my corner of the internet :)


âœ¨ [More on me](/more-on-me)
