## Hey, I‚Äôm Kristie! üëã
I'm a crypto geek, lifelong student (currently at UC Berkeley), and human being. (she/her)

My "resum√©" curiosities include startups, decentralized systems, fintech, diversity/equity/inclusion, and product. Beyond work, though, I‚Äôve been reflecting on wellness, sustainable happiness, privilege, relationships, and success. Welcome to my corner of the internet :)

## Next up
I'm looking to join a mid-stage crypto company, summer 2022, in a SWE intern role!

* Would particularly love to join an inclusivity-minded company focused on financial accessibility or emerging markets, but also open to adjacent opportunities.
* I'm based in SF, open to remote, but would love to spend time in NYC or elsewhere.

## Contact
If you‚Äôve read this far, please say hi ü§ç My DMs are open!

One of my goals is to do some international city-hopping post-grad and would love to have friends across the world to do that.
