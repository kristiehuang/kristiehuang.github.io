I'm a software engineer at Uniswap Labs in NYC. Graduated from UC Berkeley M.E.T. with degrees in EECS + Business in 2023.

I care deeply about building a more inclusive world. It’s why I’ve spent so much energy on building radical globally-equitable financial systems at Uniswap Labs & Novi Financial, and creating better innovation ecosystems through my work at she256, Nascent & Pantera Capital.

I’m also Type A planner who seeks out Type II fun. I love hard hikes,
backpacking, volleyball, immersive travel, and being out on the water.
In college, I paddled competitively with Cal Dragon Boat. After
graduating, I travelled Europe solo for a month and hiked (part
of) the Tour du Mont Blanc. Being able to stay active is a privilege I
don’t take for granted since I could never participate in sports growing
up due to my scoliosis.
