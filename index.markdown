## Hey, Iâ€™m Kristie! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my corner of the Internet! Iâ€™m a full-time dual-degree student at UC Berkeley (go bears), full-time DeFi evangelist, and, most importantly, full-time human being.

I use she/her pronouns. My curiosities include startups, crypto, diversity/equity/inclusion, and product. More recently, though, Iâ€™ve been thinking about wellness/happiness, solitude, and what it means to be successful. I also recently moved into my first ever apartment; please send me your Pinterest boards and favorite houseplant recommendations :)
