## Hey, I‚Äôm Kristie! üëã

I'm a crypto geek, lifelong student (currently at UC Berkeley), and human being. (she/her)

My "resum√©" curiosities include startups, web3/crypto, emerging market macroecon, diversity/equity/inclusion, and product. Beyond work, though, I‚Äôve been reflecting on wellness, sustainable happiness, privilege, relationships, and success. Welcome to my corner of the internet :)
