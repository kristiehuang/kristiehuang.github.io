I'm a software engineer at Uniswap Labs in NYC. Recent 2023 grad from UC Berkeley M.E.T. with degrees in EECS + Business.

I’m a crypto geek who’s spent time working for crypto protocols,
wallets, venture funds, and nonprofits. Building a more inclusive world
matters a lot to me — it’s why I’ve spent so much energy working towards
more globally-inclusive financial systems, gender equity in tech, and
better innovation ecosystems. In college, wrote code as an
intern at Uniswap Labs, Nascent, Novi Financial (FB Crypto). Led
operations at she256, and interned on the platform team at Pantera
Capital.

I’m also Type A planner who seeks out Type II fun. I love hard hikes,
backpacking, volleyball, immersive travel, and being out on the water.
In college, I paddled competitively with Cal Dragon Boat. After
graduating, I travelled Europe solo for a couple weeks and hiked (part
of) the Tour du Mont Blanc. Being able to stay active is a privilege I
don’t take for granted since I could never participate in sports growing
up due to my scoliosis.
