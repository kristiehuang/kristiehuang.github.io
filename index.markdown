## Hey, Iâ€™m Kristie! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a blockchain geek, UC Berkeley student, and human being. (she/her)

My "resumÃ©" curiosities include startups, crypto, diversity/equity/inclusion, and product. Beyond work, though, Iâ€™ve been reflecting on my wellness/happiness, privilege, solitude, and what it means to be successful. Welcome to my corner of the internet :)
