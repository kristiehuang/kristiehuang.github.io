## Hi - I’m Kristie! 👋

I’m a senior @ UC Berkeley studying EECS + Business, and a huge crypto geek who's spent time working for crypto protocols, wallets, venture funds, and nonprofits.
Building a more inclusive world matters a lot to me — it's why I've spent so much energy working towards more globally-inclusive financial systems, gender equity in tech, and better innovation ecosystems.

I love to stay active: it's a privilege I don't take for granted since I could never participate in sports growing up due to my scoliosis. I also try to make time for myself & my loved ones as often as I can — and cuddling with my beloved maltipoo whenever I have a chance to be home with family.
