<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Heya; welcome to my corner of the Internet. I'm a full-time dual-degree student at UC Berkeley (go bears), full-time DeFi evangelist, and, most importantly, full-time human being.</p>

<p>I use she/her pronouns. My curiosities include startups, decentralized finance, diversity/equity/inclusion, and product. More recently, though, I've been thinking about wellness/happiness, solitude, and what it means to be successful. I also recently moved into my first ever apartment; please send me your Pinterest boards and favorite houseplant recommendations :)</p>
