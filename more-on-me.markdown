### Fun facts

- I'm officially certified in wilderness first aid.
- I have idiopathic scoliosis! Wore a plastic back brace for 23 hours a day from 4th to 9th grade to avoid open-back surgery. I was a hardy fourth grader—literally :’) When I was 14, I started a [Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/state-of-california-mandate-life-saving-scoliosis-screenings-in-elementary-schools) to the CA governor to mandate scoliosis screenings in elementary schools. It gathered hundreds of comments & 10k signatures. Nothing came out of it though, unfortunately.
- In 7-9th grade, I ran a [studyblr](https://studycxlture.tumblr.com/) with 10k followers :)
- an ESTJ
- Swift was the very first programming language I learned... even before Python :')
- Love dried fruits too much for my own good
- big on lowercasing whenever possible
