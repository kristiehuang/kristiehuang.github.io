### Art & colors:

From the age of five, I believed I was destined to become an oil painter. I was essentially fostered for twelve years in a small, unventilated art studio. Growing up, most of my jeans and pants were splattered with [paint](https://www.behance.net/gallery/72001185/Kristie-Huang-Art-Portfolio).

So I’m a pretty visual learner and thinker. To me, someone’s favorite color says a lot about them. Coral-red #ff9980 is my favorite color—it’s bright, energetic, and powerfully feminine. My friends call it “Kristie red” :)

### My thoughts on crypto:

Vanessa Slavich from Celo breaks crypto down into three camps: [“get rich quick, libertarians, and social change”](https://link.medium.com/wMcJmALc68). I’m personally, like Vanessa, most excited about the latter — financial inclusion & accessibility made possible by DeFi. In 2020, billions of people across the globe have access to a mobile phone but don’t have access to crossborder financial systems.

Beyond financial accessibility though, I think there are some really exciting projects using blockchain to push the boundaries of everything that we know. Off the top of my head, I’m thinking about projects like Alex Masmej’s self-tokenization; Foundation using crypto as a new revenue vehicle for creators; Dharma building a neobank on top of Compound. We’re able to redefine what it means to own something and what it means to have money.

But, despite all the cool things being currently worked on, there’s so much more work to be done. We can’t have widespread crypto adoption without important work done in user experience — to this day, crypto’s understood to the layman & laywoman as nothing but a volatile commodity and a payment vehicle for illegal marketplaces. And for those just starting to explore crypto, technical jargon like [“gas”, “seed phrases”, and “non-custodial”](https://www.dharma.io/) scare beginners away. From a regulatory standpoint, Libra’s still absolutely pushing the envelope by building a whole new payment rail from scratch. Smart contract exploits happen all the time. [Financial inclusion can’t happen unless the people building these systems are diverse.](http://she256.org/) (And we still don’t know who Satoshi is.) I think, for the time being at least, that this is where I want be.

### On... tech?

I almost went to art school. Spent 10+ hours in the art studio every weekend all throughout grade school. Won a couple writing contests in [elementary](https://web.archive.org/web/20120415084842/http://www.tuolumne.org/content/article.php/20120410143026414) + [middle](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421063816/http://sanfrancisco.adl.org/news/41827/) [school](https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/05/21/palo-alto-student-wins-essay-contest/). In seventh grade, I got to 25k/50k words in my NaNoWriMo novel. I headed my [high school's creative magazine](https://issuu.com/pandorasbox.gunn) for two years, growing readership by 20x. I debated in Model UN for two years. Then I nearly became an international relations / economics major (thank you, [YYGS](https://globalscholars.yale.edu/international-affairs-globalization)!). I was never a ~tech~ person & won’t ever be fully tech to the core.

I do love to create though, and I’m passionate about creating impact. I’m still figuring things out, but I think this is where software’s speed of iteration and accessibility to beginners ultimately won out. Things first started as I ventured from physical painting&drawing to [designing mobile interfaces](https://www.behance.net/kristiehuang). Then, after dozens of Sketch files and Invision prototypes, I wanted to try my hand at building out some of these products.

I was very privileged to be able to spend my 10th grade summer with Make School—where I first learned to code & shipped my first two [real](http://tinyurl.com/cloudcloset) [products](http://tinyurl.com/airtimeevents). Cue the [hackathons](https://devpost.com/kristiehuang), compsci classes, and engineering major declaration. Along the way, I learned the 16-character term for new product creation: entrepreneurship. It was an opportunity to translate ideas into real impact for real people.

So now I’m pursuing a dual-degree in EECS and Business in UC Berkeley’s M.E.T. program. Sounds real ~tech-trash-to-the-core~, I know. I think it’s the fastest path from where I am to being able to create things to help people though.

### Diversity, equity, and inclusion
no brainer.
Thank you to Rewriting the Code + NCWIT + Built By Girls + Tech Ladies for being THE reason why I'm in tech today. I LITERALLY would not be in tech if it wasn't for these online support systems. Cannot stress this enough. I give back my time frequently to younger girls breaking into tech + helping with college apps, because I know how absolutely essential it was for me.
Actively working on being a better intersectional feminist (#BlackLivesMatter) and doing important work at she256.

### Miscellaneous:

* I have idiopathic scoliosis! Wore a back brace for 23 hours a day from 4th to 9th grade to avoid open-back surgery. I was a hardy fourth grader—literally :’) When I was 14, I started a [Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/state-of-california-mandate-life-saving-scoliosis-screenings-in-elementary-schools) to the CA governor to mandate scoliosis screenings in elementary schools. It gathered hundreds of heartfelt comments & 10k signatures. Nothing came out of it though, unfortunately.
