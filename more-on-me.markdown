### Learning in 'public'

Started in 2020, put on hiatus for a while, but bringing back now: [my 'learning in public' notebook](https://kristiehuang.notion.site/kristie-learns-in-public-cc9ff63eabc64d27a3efe45369fccd88?pvs=4).

Learning (outside of school) has always been a pretty private, siloed experience for me. The intention is to be more authentic and transparent with my progress, and I’m starting by publicizing some of my own messy, non-linear notes. I’m not editing for the public eye, so there’s no guarantee for grammar, orderliness, or correctness. Inspired by [this article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).

Topics vary based on whatever I'm interested in; notes topics include DeFi, urbanism, energy policy, startup equity, notes on books I've read, etc.

### Fun facts

- I'm officially certified in wilderness first aid.
- I have idiopathic scoliosis! Wore a plastic back brace for 23 hours a day from 4th to 9th grade to avoid open-back surgery. I was a hardy fourth grader—literally :’) When I was 14, I started a [Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/state-of-california-mandate-life-saving-scoliosis-screenings-in-elementary-schools) to the CA governor to mandate scoliosis screenings in elementary schools. It gathered hundreds of comments & 10k signatures. Nothing came out of it though, unfortunately.
- In 7-9th grade, I ran a [studyblr](https://studycxlture.tumblr.com/) with 10k followers :)
- an ESTJ
- Swift was the very first programming language I learned... even before Python :')
- Love dried fruits too much for my own good
- big on lowercasing whenever possible
